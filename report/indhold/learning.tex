\section{Learning}
We are supposed to develop a recommender system, so that it gets easier to match users with items.
In this case match users with movies they might like.
There are two paradigms of recommender systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Content-based
\item Collaborative
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Content-based} is to pair users with items by looking at the stuff they have liked in the past.
For movies e.g. it would genre, actors etc.

\paragraph{Collaborative} is to pair users with items by looking at other users in their network.
This is based on that users like similar items based on their peers.
