\section{Data Manipulation}
\paragraph{The data} provided was big chunk of files where each file represents a movie.
Each file consists of 'userId, rating' pairs on each line.
There was also provided a probe file for testing the result.
The probe file consists of movieId's followed by a list of userId's.

\paragraph{Parsing}
For this section we wrote a parser to get the data provided.
One of the challenges was to complete the probe data by searching the movies and find the userId's rating.
Their rating was than saved in the probe file and removed in the movie file where it was found.
This was so we had some data for testing.
After manipulating the data it was saved to files.
