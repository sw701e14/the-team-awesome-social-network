\chapter{Network Clustering}
%The network has distinct communities. In one community, Amazon is running a very convincing mass-advertising campaign. In another community there is a very convincing person. In the remaining communities nothing special is happening (there will be somewhere between 2 and 10 communities in the network). It is important to identify communities in order to do a good job.
%How did you do the community detection? What were the results? Argue for you choice of algorithm or describe what you would have done, if you have had more time.
%A community “friendships.txt” file can be found in the Moodle resource folder. It should be self-explanatory (no reviews are added yet, but be ready to read in the reviews later).
