The classification is about learning from a set of data.
When the learned model then is given some new data it should give back a classification of the given data based on the learned model.
The classification in this context uses a score from 1 to 5, where it groups together 1 and 2, 3, 4 and 5.
\subsection{Naive Bayes Classifier}
For calculating the score we used Naive Bayes.
Starting of with calculating the probabilities for positive(4-5), neutral(3) and negative(1-2).
This we used for calculating the score for each of the classifiers.
When evaluating a review its score gets calculated and the classifier with the highest score will be the prediction.
